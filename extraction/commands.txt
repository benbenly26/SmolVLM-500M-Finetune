The trained model adapter has been uploaded, and the folder path has been added.
From the adapter, we need to provide a PDF and download the extracted images.
After downloading the images, they should be converted into Markdown format.
These Markdown files will then be converted back into a PDF for manual validation.
This process helps in understanding how the trained model performs extraction and generates output.
